The Snake Game using Python - Turtle Graphics: Python's built-in Turtle module for creating the game's graphical interface. 
It's a simple yet engaging project where players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food items while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. This project is a great way to explore fundamental concepts in Python programming, game development, and user interface design.
